 ##  Bit Manipulation
 
 # divide by 2 get remainders gives binary num of decimal num
 # multiply by 2^p each binary digit and adding them gives decimal num of binary
 
 # left shift by n 
    int totalSubsets = `1 << n`;
In C++, 1 << n is a bitwise left shift operation that shifts the binary representation of the number 1 to the left by n positions. This is equivalent to calculating
